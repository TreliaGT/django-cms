# Headless CMS (Work in Progress)

This project is a **work in progress** aimed at creating a **headless CMS** built with Django.

## Overview

The goal is to build a flexible, scalable content management system that serves content via APIs without being tied to any frontend framework â€” perfect for modern web apps, mobile apps, and more.

## Current Status

- Core architecture is being developed
- Basic app structure in place (`pages`, `adminpanel`, etc.)
- Context processors and template setup underway
- Headless API endpoints to be implemented soon
